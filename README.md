# Face Recognition System

## Overview

The **Face Recognition System** is a Python-based project designed to detect and recognize faces in images. This system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to accurately identify and verify individuals based on their facial features.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in images and video streams using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces with a known database to identify individuals.
- **Real-time Processing:** Capable of recognizing faces in real-time using webcam input.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple interface to capture, process, and recognize faces.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Face_recognition**: A library for face recognition based on deep learning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Face_recognition
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face_recognition_system.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd face_recognition_system
   ```
3. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Face Detection:** Run the script to detect faces in an image or video.
2. **Face Recognition:** Add known faces to the database and run the recognition script to identify individuals.
3. **Real-time Recognition:** Use your webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
